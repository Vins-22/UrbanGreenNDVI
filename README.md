# 🌿 Urban Green Space Analysis Using NDVI and Zonal Statistics

This project analyzes urban green space in Delhi by computing the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and performing **zonal statistics** to calculate the average NDVI for each urban ward.

## 📍 Study Area

The study focuses on **urban wards in Delhi**, India, analyzing the spatial distribution of green spaces using NDVI as a vegetation indicator.

---

## 📥 Data Sources

- **Sentinel-2 Imagery (Bands 4 and 8)**  
  Downloaded from the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)  
  Provided by the **European Space Agency (ESA)** under the **Copernicus Programme**

- **Delhi Ward Boundary Shapefile**  
  Sourced from **ArcGIS Online**, contributed by user: **ncrtcoffice**

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. Load Sentinel-2 Band 4 (Red) and Band 8 (NIR)
2. Calculate NDVI using the formula:  
   `NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
3. Save the NDVI raster
4. Load Delhi ward boundary shapefile
5. Perform **zonal statistics** to compute average NDVI per ward
6. Save the output shapefile with `avg_ndvi` values
7. Visualize the results using a choropleth map

## 🐍 How to Run This Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UrbanGreenNDVI.git
   cd UrbanGreenNDVI
   ```

2. **Set up the environment (requires Conda)**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate greenspace
   ```

3. **Ensure the `data/` folder contains**:
   - `B04_clipped.tif` ← Band 4 (Red)
   - `B08_clipped.tif` ← Band 8 (NIR)
   - `wards_boundary.shp` and its associated files

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/ndvi_analysis.py
   ```
